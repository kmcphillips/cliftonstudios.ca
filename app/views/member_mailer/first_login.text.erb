Clifton Studios - New Website Login
------------------------------------

Hello <%= @member.name %>,

The new Clifton Studios website is live! It's like the old one, except much better.

If you weren't familliar with the old website, it's somewhere where all members can upload their pictures, type up a bio, and keep track of studo news and events. Non-members can use it to contact the studio, to look at images, find out when show/sales/workshops are happening, and other general Clifton Studios information.

New features include:
 * Easier to use
 * Nicer layout
 * Better management of users
 * More detailed information
 * Executive information and contact
 * Easier and cleaner image uploading
 * Public mailing list



The Important Bits
------------------

The website is here (still):
http://cliftionstudios.ca

You now login with your email address so it should be easy to remember. You have also been given a default password. You will be asked to change it on first login.

Username:   <%= @member.email %>
Password:   <%= @password %>

You can login anytime. All your old information and images were imported. There is plenty of great stuff to explore and try out.

If you have any problems, bugs, questions, or feedback just contact Kevin.
