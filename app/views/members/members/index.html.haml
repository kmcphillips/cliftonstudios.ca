%h1 Inactive Studio Members

.post
  %p
    These are members who have left the studio, permanently or temporarily. They cannot be deleted, but deactivating them will remove them from the public site and from the contact list.
    They can always be re-activated later and their content will not be lost, in case someone is leaving but is planning on coming back.

  - unless @inactive_members.any?
    %p There are currently no inactive members.
